<h3>
	Heritages of Hunger Repository
</h3>

	<p>
		This repository is an open-access educational resource which contains 
		primary materials related to periods of hunger in Europe. The memories 
		of these periods continue to impact debates on new crises and conflicts, 
		such as economic decline, refugees, Brexit, COVID-19, and war. Often, 
		memories of past hunger are evoked to stress conflict. The materials 
		collected here demonstrate that such memories actually offer 
		possibilities for transnational understanding of contested histories. 
		It is set up from this transnational angle and seeks to make explicit 
		links between different periods of hunger. You are encouraged to 
		use the materials in this repository in your teaching and learning. 
	</p>

	<p>
		It is our hope that our repository will help you to engage with these 
		materials in comparative ways, thereby stimulating empathy and 
		understanding across borders.
